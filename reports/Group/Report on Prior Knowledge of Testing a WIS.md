**Report on Prior Knowledge of Testing a WIS**

Before taking this subject, our knowledge of testing a Web Information System (WIS) was quite limited. We had not encountered this topic in detail before, and most of our understanding came from general software testing concepts rather than specific WIS testing methodologies. Below is a summary of what we knew before engaging in this topic more thoroughly.

**Basic Understanding**

Our initial understanding of WIS testing was that it involves verifying the functionality, performance, and security of a web-based system to ensure it meets user expectations. We were aware that testing is an essential phase in software development, but we had little exposure to specialized techniques used for WIS.

**Knowledge of Testing Concepts**

Although we did not have in-depth knowledge of WIS testing, we were somewhat familiar with general testing practices, such as:
- **Functional Testing**: We understood that this ensures all features of a web system work as intended.
- **Unit Testing**: We knew that developers write unit tests to validate small portions of code, often using frameworks like JUnit or Jest.
- **Manual vs. Automated Testing**: We had a basic idea that tests could be performed manually by testers or automated using tools like Selenium or Cypress.

**Limited Awareness of WIS-Specific Testing**

Before studying this subject, we were not fully aware of the specific testing approaches used for WIS, including:
- **Performance Testing**: We knew web applications need to be tested for load handling but were unfamiliar with tools like JMeter.
- **Security Testing**: We had heard of web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS but did not know how to systematically test against them.
- **Usability Testing**: We understood the importance of user experience (UX) but lacked methods to evaluate it formally.

**Summary of Gaps in Knowledge**

Before this subject, our knowledge of WIS testing was fragmented and mostly theoretical. We lacked:
- A clear understanding of specific testing frameworks for WIS.
- Knowledge of performance, security, and usability testing.
- Hands-on experience with automated testing tools tailored for web applications.

**Learning Goals in DP2**

As we progress in **Design and Testing 2 (DP2)**, we aim to expand our knowledge and skills in WIS testing by:
- Learning about industry-standard testing tools and techniques.
- Applying different types of tests (functional, security, performance, usability) to a real WIS.
- Gaining practical experience with automated testing frameworks.

By the end of this course, we hope to develop a structured approach to testing WIS, ensuring that the systems we work on are reliable, efficient, and secure.
