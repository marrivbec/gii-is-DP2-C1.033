# **Report on Prior Knowledge of WIS Architecture**

Before taking this subject, our knowledge of Web Information System (WIS) architecture was quite limited. We had not been exposed to this specific term frequently, and our understanding was mainly based on general web development concepts. Below is a summary of what we knew about WIS architecture before diving deeper into the topic.

**Basic Understanding**

Our initial understanding of WIS was that it refers to systems that manage, store, and distribute information over the web. We were aware that such systems involve a combination of databases, web servers, and client-side interfaces to provide users with access to structured and unstructured data.

**Knowledge of Components**

Although we did not know the specific architecture of WIS, we had some familiarity with the following key components:
- **Web Servers**: We knew that web servers, such as Apache or Nginx, handle HTTP requests and serve web pages to users.
- **Databases**: We understood that web applications often rely on databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB to store and retrieve information.
- **Front-end and Back-end Development**: We had some experience with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end frameworks such as Node.js, Django, or Spring Boot.

**Limited Awareness of WIS-Specific Architectures**

Before studying this subject, we were not fully aware of the architectural patterns specific to WIS, such as:
- **Three-tier architecture**: We had a vague understanding that web applications often separate the presentation layer, business logic, and data storage, but we did not explicitly associate this with WIS.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: We knew that some web systems use APIs to communicate between services but were not familiar with its role in WIS.
- **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: We had heard of CMS platforms like WordPress and Drupal but did not consider them part of WIS architecture.

**Summary of Gaps in Knowledge**

Before this subject, our knowledge of WIS architecture was fragmented and mostly focused on individual technologies rather than a holistic system. We lacked:
- A clear definition of WIS and its scope.
- Understanding of different architectural styles used in WIS.
- Awareness of best practices in designing scalable and secure WIS.

By studying this subject, we aim to gain a more structured and comprehensive understanding of WIS architecture, enabling us to design, implement, and optimize such systems effectively.
