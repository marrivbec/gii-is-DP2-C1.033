    # **Chartering Report**

## **1. Summary**
The selection of the working group members was carried out simply through the forum. To choose the members, we focused on people we had previously worked with, prioritizing trust and knowledge of their work style. In this case, we had already collaborated on previous projects, making the decision easier.

## **3. Commitment Statement**

We, the members of group **C1.033**, commit to working together in the course Design and Testing 2. We declare that we have understood the syllabus, with a special focus on the evaluation and grading procedures, and we commit to achieving the following grade: **8**.

---

## **4. Performance Indicators**

- **Work Completed vs. Pending Work:**  

  The team's progress will be measured by the percentage of tasks completed in GitHub Projects. The number of tasks in the "Done" column will be considered in relation to the total assigned tasks.

  Additionally, a weekly review will be conducted to verify that the delivered work meets expected standards, and any delays or blockages will be recorded.

- **Feedback from the Professor:**  

  The professor's feedback during project review sessions in laboratory classes will be considered to evaluate and improve our performance.
  
- **Another Relevant Indicator - Active Participation in the Team:** 
  To assess each member's commitment, the following metrics will be measured: 
  - **Number of commits and contributions on GitHub:** The frequency of contributions to the repository will be analyzed.  
  - **Participation in meetings and decision-making:** A record will be kept of who actively attends team meetings and participates in decision-making. 

---

## **5. Reward System**

Group members who achieve **good performance** will be rewarded as follows:
- They will receive preferential treatment from the rest of the group.
- They may receive a higher grade if both the professor and the group agree.

---

## **6. Sanction System**

Group members who have **poor performance** will be warned as follows:

- First warning: The affected member will be verbally or in writing notified about their poor performance, urging them to improve their commitment to the project.
- Second warning: If poor performance persists, the group will issue a final warning, stating that continued lack of commitment could result in their expulsion.
- Group expulsion: In case of recurrence, the team will inform the professor of their intention to dismiss the participant, thereby ending their collaboration in the project.

(This system follows a similar structure to soccer cards: the first two warnings correspond to yellow cards, while the third results in expulsion, similar to a red card.)

---

## **7. Conditions for Expulsion**

A group member may be expelled under the following conditions:
- If they are unwilling to cooperate with their teammates in completing our work.
- Conflicts with other team members.
- Unnecessary or insufficient work.

**Options after being dismissed:**
- Continue working alone.
- Drop the course.
- Find another group.
